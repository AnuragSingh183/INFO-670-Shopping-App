Server API Design and Specification

Firebase Firestore & Authentication were used for backend services.
Endpoints and Operations
/products

Method: GET

Purpose: Fetch a list of all available products

Parameters: None

Implementation: Queried using Firebase getDocs(collection(db, 'products'))

/wishlists/:uid

Method: GET

Purpose: Retrieve the wishlist items for a specific user

Parameters: Firebase Auth UID

Implementation: Read the document wishlists/{uid} from Firestore.


/cart/:uid
Method: PUT
Purpose: Add/Update/Remove item in cart
Data: JSON with { productId, quantity, ... }
Implementation: Update the items array in cart/{uid}

/wishlists/:uid

Method: PUT

Purpose: Add or remove a product from the user's wishlist

Data: JSON object with the product structure like { id, name, price, image, ... }

Implementation: Update the items field inside the wishlists/{uid} Firestore document.


Example API Flow:

On app load, the app uses Firebase Auth to retrieve the user's ID.
Cart:

When a user adds an item to the cart, the product is stored in cart/{uid} as part of a document with a items array.

The quantity can be updated, and the entire cart can be fetched via getDoc(doc(db, 'cart', uid)).

Orders:

Upon checkout, the cart data is used to create a document in orders/{uid}/user_orders/{orderId}.

Each order contains cart items, order total, timestamp, and optionally shipping info


Experiences

This project was an end-to-end mobile app built with React Native (Expo), Firebase Authentication, and Firestore. 

Key experiences included:
Firebase Integration: We replaced local state with real-time Firestore sync for wishlist storage.
UI Design: Crafted a modern UI with categorized cards, horizontal lists, and responsive layout.
Wishlist Toggle Logic: Built a context-based solution for managing global wishlist state.
Challenges: Syncing state after login, handling async Firestore operations, and styling scrollable lists.
Best Practices: Code modularity, context providers, reusable components (ProductCard, CategoryCard), and loader handling using ShimmerPlaceholder.
Future Plans: Add Stripe checkout, user reviews, and category-based filtering with Firebase queries.
